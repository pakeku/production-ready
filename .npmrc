node-linker=hoisted

# TL;DR: This avoids "module not found" errors in apps or shared packages
# within the monorepo that expect a standard Node.js-style node_modules layout.
#
# Reference: https://pnpm.io/npmrc#node-linker
#
# Why this is important in a Turborepo:
#
# Turborepo manages multiple packages (apps and packages) in a monorepo.
# By default, pnpm creates a "strict" node_modules structure where each package
# only sees its direct dependencies. This is great for avoiding version conflicts,
# but it can cause issues in monorepos where:
#   - Apps depend on shared packages (like a shared UI library)
#   - Bundlers or tools (Metro for React Native, Next.js, Storybook, Jest) assume
#     a flat node_modules structure and cannot resolve nested dependencies automatically.
#
# Setting `node-linker=hoisted` makes pnpm mimic the traditional flat layout:
#   - Most dependencies are hoisted to the repo root node_modules.
#   - Apps and packages can find sibling package dependencies without extra configuration.
#   - Ensures smoother integration with Turborepo caching, incremental builds, and tooling.
